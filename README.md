# Capturing Screen Content in macOS
Stream desktop content like displays, apps, and windows by adopting screen capture in your app.

## Overview
Starting in macOS 12.3, the platform provides a new framework called ScreenCaptureKit. It offers a simple API that enables you to add high-performance screen-capture capabilities to your Mac app. This sample app shows how to use the framework to filter, configure, and stream desktop content like displays, apps, and windows.

## Configure the Sample Code Project
- The sample requires Xcode 13.3 beta or later to build and macOS 12.3 beta or later to run.
- The first time you run the sample, the system prompts you to grant the app Screen Recording permission. Grant permission and restart the app to enable capture.
